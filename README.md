# Introduction
UniPicto is an open-source Universal Pictogram database incremented as it goes, following inspiration and welcomming any contribution.

# Vision
This project is intended as an ever-growing pictogram database, open-sourced for commercial and personal use, with CC-BY-SA license (see LICENSE.md file).
It welcomes any new pictos belonging to specific styles as well as the creation of new styles for existing pictos.

# Organization
The database is simply set up in directories which, for now, serve as categories.
As it goes, multiple pictos happen to belong into several categories, which will utltimately lead to structural changes.
Ultimately, pictos are organized in three styles for now :

- minimalist
- flat design
- realistic
